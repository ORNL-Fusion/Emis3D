    "This is the first thing that should be done when adding a new tokamak to Emis3D. You'll need files such as the tokamak configuration file (example: `tokamaks/DIII-D/DIII-D_settings.yaml`) and information about each bolometer. There are additional optional files such as a 3D CAD file of the outer wall, which is used to build the observable universe. See the `sxrChordPlotter.ipynb` demo for more information about bolometer implementation."

    "The experimental data should be calibrated and processed prior to running the main Emis3D program. The older method to incorporate everything into one large package was removed during the refactor since grabbing and calibrating data is unique to every machine. We have included several programs on how to do this with DIII-D under `tokamaks/DIII-D/sxrSavers/`. The important thing to note is that it is required to have these variables in the h5 experimental data file: [\"channelOrder\",\"TIME\",\"DATA_CALIBRATED\",\"DATA_CALIBRATED_ERROR\",\"DATA_CALIBRATED_UNITS\"]. The program will then compare the experimental channel order to that done when creating radDists and it is important that the names match in the bolometer configuration file (which is used when creating radDists) and the saved data. \n",

    "2. Cross-calibrate the data during the current quench (since DIII-D's bolometers are not absolutly calibrated) by using `crossCalibrateSXR.py`, put those scale factors in the run config file:\n",

Therefore, the better (or more realistic) radDists we have, the better the fit with data. Typically, for SPI discharges, helical distributions fit best during the initial stages, followed by elongated rings for the remaining of the discharge. See the `radDist` example for more information here. "
